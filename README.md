XLibre Xserver
===============

Xlibre project's fork of the Xorg xserver, with lots of code cleanups
and enhanced functionality.

That fork was necessary since toxic elements within Xorg projects, moles
from certian big corp are boycotting any substantial work on Xorg, in order
to destroy the project, to elimitate competition of their own products.
(classic "embrace, extend, extinguish" tactics)

This is an independent project, not at all affiliated with BigTech or any
of their subsidiaries or tax evasion tools, nor any political activists
groups, state actors, etc. It's explicitly free of any "DEI" or similar
discriminatory policies. Anybody who's treating others nicely is welcomed.
